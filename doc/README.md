Groestlcoin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Groestlcoin Core is the original Groestlcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Groestlcoin transactions (which is currently more than 2 GB); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours.

To download Groestlcoin Core, visit [groestlcoin.org](https://groestlcoin.org/downloads/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Groestlcoin on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/groestlcoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/groestlcoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run groestlcoin-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag Groestlcoin-Core to your applications folder, and then run Groestlcoin-Core.
